# Hudson

<p align="justify ">
Over the past 6 months I worked as a visiting researcher at the New York Genome Center where I have co-developed Hudson, a computational pipeline for spatial analysis of tissue images. It can be scaled from a personal computer to research computing clusters for heavy workloads. I really recommend having a quick look at the poster I made of Hudson for a National Institute of Health member meeting at Duke University School of Medicine.
