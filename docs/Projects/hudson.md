## Hudson

<p align="justify ">
Over the past 6 months, I have worked as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.nygenome.org">New York Genome Center</a> where I have co-first authored Hudson, a computational pipeline that computes how cells are distributed spatially over the tissue in a microscopy image. Diseases tend to alter these spatial distributions, and thus estimating these patterns can help in computing the risk of certain diseases, and also in personalized treatment. Hudson can easily be scaled from a personal computer to research computing clusters for heavy workloads which is generally the use case. I was a member of the technology innovation lab, a dedicated incubator for testing breakthrough genomic tools and ideas. I really recommend having a quick look at the poster I made of Hudson for the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Centers-of-Excellence-in-Genomic-Science">NIH CEGS</a> 2022 annual meeting at the Duke University School of Medicine.
