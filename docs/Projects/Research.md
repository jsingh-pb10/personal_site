## Research

I have an interest in  <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lsgs/posts/2019-09-27-info-geom.html">information geometery</a>, and working with spatial data both of which really helped me build Hudson and portfolio management tools in Hexeract. Also like to explore non-parametric or high-dimensional statistical models and chaos theory. Below are 2 published papers which I worked on during my time at McGill:

1) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11053-021-09864-y"> Exploring Deep Learning for Dig Limit Optimization in Open-Pit Mines</a>

2) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42461-021-00424-9"> Gold Copper Mining Investment Evaluation Through Multivariate Copula-Innovated Simulations</a>
