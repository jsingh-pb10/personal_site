## Research

I have an interest in  <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/">information geometry</a>, and working with spatial data both of which really helped me build Hudson and portfolio management tools in Hexeract. I also like to explore non-parametric models, high-dimensional statistics, and chaos theory. Below are 2 published papers which I worked on during my time at McGill University:

1) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11053-021-09864-y"> Exploring Deep Learning for Dig Limit Optimization in Open-Pit Mines.</a>

2) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42461-021-00424-9"> Gold Copper Mining Investment Evaluation Through Multivariate Copula-Innovated Simulations.</a>
