 P.S. : Hexeract was on the core reasons why I was able to finish Hudson at very fast speed. For Hexeract I worked with a lot of satellite derived spatial data, as it is  useful for commodites trading especially for agriculture and energy related derivates. This I had good knowledge of how to effeciently work with spatial data which is the core component of Hudson.
