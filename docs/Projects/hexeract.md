 *Post Script: Hexeract was the core reasons why I was able to finish Hudson at very fast speed. For Hexeract I worked with a lot of satellite derived geospatial data, as it is  useful for trading commidity derivaties especially for agriculture and energy related ones. Thus I had good knowledge of how to effeciently work with a huge amounts of spatial data which is the foundation of Hudson.*
