I'm Jagjit (Jug). I did my undergrad at McGill University where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum mechanics inspired trading application on high performance compute (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to spend sometime developing statistical-learning based software libraries for portfolio and risk management. I then started by Master's Degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University which I am finishing in December, and moving to San Francisco Bay Area in January. While doing my MS I have co-developed Hudson, a computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue structure) in their work, and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson I realized the value of incorporating tissue structure in disease treatment and prognosis. Especially that coupling such methodology with advances in generative AI can be used in computationally designing tissue scafolds. This will completely revolutionize precision health and drug discovery, as companies can test their candidates on the engineered tissues as per the scafold. In fact as per the US NIH, this would speed up development and provide key tools for facilitating personalized medicine while saving money and reducing the number of animals used for research.
