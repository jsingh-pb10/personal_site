## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">

I'm Jagjit (Jug). I am passionate about building scalable technology that creates a positive impact. I did my undergrad at McGill University where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a high-frequency trading firm as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their trading application on high performance compute(HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research too. I left the firm to develop statistical learning based software libraries for portfolio and risk management. Sometime later I started by Master's Degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University which I am finishing in December. While doing my MS I have built a computational pipeline that saves significant time for healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate topological and geometric information in their work and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases that can alter tissue structure.
