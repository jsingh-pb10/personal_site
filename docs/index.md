## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">

I'm Jagjit (Jug). I did my undergrad at McGill University, where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum physics inspired trading application on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to develop a statistical/machine learning based software library for portfolio management and sometime later also concurrently started my masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University. I was able to finish the portfolio management project around December 2021, and I am finishing my master's degree this December. While doing my MS, I have co-developed Hudson. It is a computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue structure) in their work and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson, I realized the value of incorporating tissue structure in disease prognosis and treatment. Coupling such methodology with advances in AI can be used in simulating human-like tissues. Such technology would completely revolutionize precision health and drug discovery as companies can test their drug candidates on the engineered tissues based on simulations. In fact, as per the US NIH, this would speed up development and provide critical tools for facilitating personalized medicine while saving money and reducing the number of animals used for research. 

I will be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in February next year to do a start-up.
