## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">

I'm Jagjit (Jug). I did my undergrad at McGill University, where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum physics inspired trading application on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to develop statistical/machine learning based software libraries for portfolio and risk management and sometime later also started my masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University. I am finishing my degree in December and moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in February. While doing my MS, I co-developed Hudson. It is a computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue structure) in their work and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson, I realized the value of incorporating tissue structure in disease treatment and prognosis. Coupling such methodology with advances in generative AI can be used in computationally designing tissues. Such technology would completely revolutionize precision health and drug discovery, as companies can test their candidates on the engineered tissues from the computed design. In fact, as per the US NIH, this would speed up development and provide critical tools for facilitating personalized medicine while saving money and reducing the number of animals used for research.
