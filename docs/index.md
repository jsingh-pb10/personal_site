## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">
  
I'm Jagjit (Jug). I did my undergrad at McGill University where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a high-frequency trading firm as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their trading application on high performance compute (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to spend sometime developing statistical-learning based software libraries for portfolio and risk management. I then started by Master's Degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University which I am finishing in December. While doing my MS I have built Hudson, a computational pipeline supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue architecture) in their work, and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson I realized the value of incorporating tissue architecture in disease treatment and prognosis. Especially that coupling such methodology with advances in generative AI can be used in designing new tissues for treatment purposes. This will completely revolutionize healthcare.
