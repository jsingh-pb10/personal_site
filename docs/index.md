## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">
 
 I'm Jagjit (Jeet). I did my undergrad at McGill University, where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum physics-inspired trading application on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to develop a statistical/machine learning based software library for portfolio management. Later, I also concurrently started my Master's degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University, both of which I have completed. While doing my MS, I co-developed Hudson. It is a AI/ML based computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue structure) in their work and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson, I realized the value of incorporating tissue structure (Spatial Biology) in healthcare. Thus, I am building Flahybase, a cloud-native storage application for spatial biology, and a proprietary file format with a programming package for scalable spatial biology analysis.
