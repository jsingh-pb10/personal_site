## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">

I'm Jagjit (Jeet). I did my undergrad at McGill University, where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum physics inspired trading application on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to develop a statistical/machine learning based software library for portfolio management and sometime later also concurrently started my Master's degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University, both of which I have completed. While doing my MS, I co-developed Hudson. It is a computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (tissue structure) in their work and can be used to compute the risk of certain diseases. While building Hudson, I realized the value of incorporating tissue structure in disease prognosis and treatment. More importantly, I saw the explosion of super-high-resolution image data that new tissue imaging technologies produce. However, without accessible software applications to appropriately store and analyze these datasets, it is a loss of biotechnology potential and positive impact. Given the nature and size of these images, it is complicated and expensive for many students, researchers, and scientists to use them as a source of information for their investigation. Thus, I have decided to build flahy, a cloud application for cost-efficient storage and interactive analysis of large multi-dimensional images produced by these new technologies.
