## Hi! Nice to meet you.

### A bit about myself:
<p align="justify ">

I'm Jagjit (Jeet). I did my undergrad at McGill University, where I majored in statistics. Following that, I worked at a private investment fund as a quantitative developer. I played an integral role in building their quantum physics-inspired trading application on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and was involved in quantitative research. I left the firm to develop a statistical/machine learning-based software library for portfolio management. Later, I also concurrently started my Master's degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University, both of which I have completed. While doing my MS, I co-developed Hudson. It is an AI/ML based computational pipeline that supports healthcare researchers wanting to incorporate spatial patterns of cells (Spatial Biology) in their work and can be used for target and biomarker discovery in oncology. While building Hudson, I realized the value of incorporating tissue architecture (Spatial Biology) in target and biomarker discovery. Thus, I am building Flahybase, a cloud-native platform for target and biomarker discovery from tumor microenvironments.
