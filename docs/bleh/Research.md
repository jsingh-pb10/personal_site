## Research

I am interested in information geometry and working with spatial data, which helped me build Hudson and portfolio management tools for Hexeract. I also like to explore non-parametric models, high-dimensional statistics, chaos theory, and graphical models. Below are a few research papers I have written. This first one is for an advanced course on Graphical Models at Columbia University, and the other two are published papers that I worked on during my time at McGill University:

1) <a href="https://github.com/jsingh-pb10/personal_site/blob/main/docs/Projects/graph_med.pdf">Improving X-Ray Disease Classification by combining Probabilistic Graphical Models and Variational Inference with Deep Neural Networks.</a>

2) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11053-021-09864-y"> Exploring Deep Learning for Dig Limit Optimization in Open-Pit Mines.</a>

3) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42461-021-00424-9"> Gold Copper Mining Investment Evaluation Through Multivariate Copula-Innovated Simulations.</a>
